<center><h1>Snapshot Backup - FAQ</h1></center>

<h4>How can I verify that Snapshot did what it claimed - backup all my data</h4>
<blockquote>
The easiest and fastest way:
<p>Backup a drive.<br>
Map the drive as virtual drive.<br>
Use WINDIFF or similar file
compare tools to compare the two drives; they should be identical.</p>
<p>You will see differences, because WINDIFF will not be able to open the
PAGEFILE or registry files on the original drive; but that's not SNAPSHOT's
fault.<br>
For these files you have to trust us (of course we tested this, using
slightly more complicated setup's)</p>
</blockquote>



<h4>Do I have to shut down all Windows programs (highly recommended)</h4>
<blockquote>
No.<br>
It's probably a good idea to save your open files before starting Snapshot Backup.<br>

Otherwise you would eventually get outdated data on your disk.<br>

After Snapshot has started you may continue to work normally, the image will reflect the data at start time.<br>

</blockquote>

<h4>May I install a new VIRUS, while Snapshot is running?</h4>

<blockquote>Yes.<br>
It won't make you happy, but Snapshot won't care.<br>
The created image will not contain any sign of a virus, ready to be restored.<br>

</blockquote>

<h4>May I FORMAT/FDISK the disk that is currently being Snapshot'ed?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
No.<br>
It is not possible to run programs that access the disk directly while Snapshot is running.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>What File systems does Snapshot support?</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
SnapShot relies mostly on the operating system to support a
drive.<br>
All file systems known to Windows(FAT16, FAT32, NTFS) are
supported; additionally some LINUX file systems (EXT2,EXT3,Ext4,XFS,Reiser) are
'manually' supported.<br>

Other file system are stored completely, ignoring any free space information.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Does Snapshot support enhanced NTFS features like encryption, security, hard and symbolic links, mount points, multiple data streams, extended
attributes,quota,...</h4>
<blockquote>Yes.<br>
Snapshot is sector-oriented.<br>
Snapshot will backup all sectors relevant for the
  file system, and restore them exactly the same way.<br>
Snapshot never interprets these data on its own, the interpretation of these data is up to the
  file system.<br>
Snapshot only provides the necessary data.<br>
The same is true for the Image Viewer.<br>
