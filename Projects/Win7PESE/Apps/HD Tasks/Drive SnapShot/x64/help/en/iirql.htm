<center><h1>Troubleshooting - IRQL7</h1></center>
Some users have reported either<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Snapshot error: Strange error while reading data</b><br>
or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Snapshot error: Driver reported error: &lt;1634: IRQL5&gt;</b>
<p>The reason is, that some unusual driver modifies the kernel internals in a
way, that disk access is used with Paging (virtual memory management) disabled.<br>

This is unusual and probably due to some lazy driver programmer (whoever it is).</p>
<p>So far Drive Snapshot's 'politic' has been to avoid to run in an unknown
environment (to avoid bluescreens as much as possible); therefore the backup is
aborted as soon as above condition is detected.</p>
<p>Starting from 1.32 (4 dec 2003), Snapshot has been modified to allow to
continue in this condition.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">Warning: Snapshot has been manually verified, it
  *should* work with paging disabled.<br>
However, it hasn't been tested on many
  systems with these conditions, as these conditions are rare, and not
  reproducible by us.<br>

  There is a certain possibility, that running Snapshot Backup will now no
  longer stop the backup, but instead </font><font color="#0000FF">BLUESCREEN </font><font color="#FF0000">your
  PC.<br>

  When running Snapshot now (specially the first time), please make sure, you
  can tolerate the (low) probability of a </font><font color="#0000FF">BLUESCREEN</font><font color="#FF0000">,
  and don't run it under productivity conditions.<br>

  Running Snapshot without the fix however is as safe as it was before.</font></p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000">Should you get a </font><font color="#0000FF">BLUESCREEN</font><font color="#FF0000">
  please go to Reporting a Bluescreen section below to help us fix this issue.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, don't be too afraid: even if Snapshot causes a bluescreen, no data
corruption will happen.<br>
When the computer reboots, you'll see a CHKDSK running;
after that the system will continue to run as usual.</p>
<h2>here's the fix.</h2>
<p>Start Snapshot from the command line, and add the parameter&nbsp;&nbsp;
'-!IRQL7'&nbsp;<br>
i.e.<br>
start either<br>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c:&gt;
C:\programs\Snapshot\snapshot -!IRQL7<br>
</b>for the GUI or<br>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c:&gt;
C:\programs\Snapshot\snapshot -!IRQL7&nbsp; C: X:\c-drive.sna&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This option is considered a temporary fix.<br>
</b>This option will vanish again as
soon as we think that it works proper; therefore we didn't invent a GUI for
it,...</p>
<p>If that fixes the problem, we want feedback.</p>
<h2>Reporting a Bluescreen</h2>
<p>If that does not fix the problem, we want feedback, too.</p>
<p>It would be nice, if you could set your system settings to 'Kernel Memory
Dump'</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My Computer -&gt;Properties -&gt;Advanced -&gt;Startup and Recovery-&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write Debugging Information = Kernel Memory Dump</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will dump all kernel memory (~50MB) into the file %SystemRoot%\MEMORY.DMP,</p>
<p>If you get a Bluescreen, we apologize.<br>
Usually, Drive Snapshot tries
everything to avoid Bluescreens.<br>
Unfortunately, the 'driver reported
error:IRQL5' bug couldn't be reproduced by us (on many test maschines), so this
is a bit running in unknown environment.</p>
<p>Please ZIP&nbsp; MEMORY.DMP and send it to <a href="mailto:support@drivesnapshot.de">support@drivesnapshot.de</a>;
we will analyse it, and try to fix the problem as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Thanks for understanding.</p>
