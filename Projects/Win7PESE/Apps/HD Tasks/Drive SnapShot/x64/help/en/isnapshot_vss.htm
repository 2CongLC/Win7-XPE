<h1 align="center">Drive Snapshot - VSS</h1>

<p align="left">Drive Snapshot offers the
possibility to use the Windows build in Volume Snapshot Copy Service (VSS) for
the creation of consistent images.</p>

<p align="left">Main advantage compared to the internal Drive Snapshot Driver is the
ability to image a running MS Exchange server, and also to image several
partitions at the same time.<br>
(<a href="#Details">See below for technical Details</a>).</p>

<h3 align="left">Usage</h3>

<p align="left">By using VSS, several drives can be imaged at the same time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">from the GUI by holding the&nbsp; Control key while clicking
    in the list</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">from the command line with&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    <b>c:&gt;snapshot c:+d:+e:&nbsp; x:\backup\computer\$DISK-FULL.sna&nbsp;<br>
    </b></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">if saving several disks at the same time, the destination
    MUST contain $DISK somewhere to differentiate the different image files</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">differential
    Images&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    <b>c:&gt;snapshot c:+d:+e:&nbsp; x:\computer\$DISK-$DATE-Diff.sna -hx:\backup\computer\$DISK-FULL.hsh<br>
    <br>
    </b>works only from the command line</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><b>&nbsp;snapshot hd1:* x:\backup\$disk.sna<br>
    <br>
    </b>saves all partitions of physical drive 1, incl.<br>
Linux, Dell, Compaq,...<br>
<b>
    </b></li>
</ul>

<h3 align="left"><a name="Details">Technical Details</a></h3>

<p align="left">Since Windows XP Windows implements a 'Volume ShadowCopy
Service' (VSS), that essentially provides the same service as the build in
Snapshot driver - that is a consistent snapshot of one (or more) partitions at a
fixed point in time.<br>

Additionally, it defines and implements a broadcast similar to:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">To everybody who cares about VSS: would you please go into a
  consistent state, bring transactions to a recoverable state, etc., and than
  please be write for some (short) time because I'm going to make a backup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">At this time, the current state of the disk is frozen, and made
available for backup programs until.<br>
Changes to the drive while the backup is
active are written to some reserved space on the disk, until the backup finishes
and tells VSS to release the buffers.</p>
<p align="left"><b>VSS advantages</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Can snapshot several volumes at the same time</p>
  <li>
    <p align="left">By using above mentioned broadcast it can also put Exchange
    Server 2003 into a stable state without shutting down exchange services,
    which isn't always reliable possible without using VSS.<br>
For other databases
    this isn't necessary (they seem to be implemented in a more stable fashion),
    but at least using VSS doesn't hurt.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>VSS disadvantages</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">by the fixed (preconfigured) size of the VSS buffers, at
    least in theory this buffer can overflow, and thus abort the backup.<br>
the
    build in driver writes changes immediately to the image, and thus can't
    overflow.</p>
  <li>
    <p align="left">by the additional buffering on disk, using VSS may be slower
    then the internal driver.</p>
  <li>
    <p align="left">VSS doesn't exist for Windows NT and Windows 2000.</p>
  <li>
    <p align="left">VSS simply doesn't work, if some older products (like older
    version of MS SQL) are running on more recent windows versions; NTBACKUP
    doesn't work in these cases either.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><b>Implementation of VSS vs.<br>
internal driver</b></p>
<p align="left">As both drivers have their pros and cons, by default the VSS
driver is only used if</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">MS Exchange 2003 or Active Directory are detected</p>
  <li>
    <p align="left">a backup of several volumes is started</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">else the internal driver is used.<br>
You may change this by using
the [Advanced Options] dialog, or from command line by</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">--noVSS: never uses VSS</p>
  <li>
    <p align="left">--UseVSS: always uses VSS, if it exists and works</p>
  <li>
    <p align="left">--ForceVSS: tries to use VSS; if VSS is not available for
    some reason, backup is aborted with error</p>
  </li>
</ul>

Snapshot can use VSS in two different modes.<br>


<h3>VSS without explicit usage of writers</h3>

<li>	Creates a shadow copy, that contains a konsistent copy of all existing 
data.</li>
<li>Snapshot uses this mode automatically if more then one partition is 
selected, or MS Exchange is detected.<br>
(in Windows SBS2003 the necessary Exchange 
writer is disabled by default, and must be enabled; see&nbsp; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/838183">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/838183)</a> </li>

<li>In this mode a Hyper-V Server would stop virtual machines running on it for 
a short time until the the shadow copy has been taken.</li>

    truncate transaction logs</li>
