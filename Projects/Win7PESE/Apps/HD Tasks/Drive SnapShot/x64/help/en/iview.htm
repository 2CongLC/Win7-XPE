Exploring the created Snapshot disk image is extremely simple and powerful : use the normal Windows explorer - or any other program you like.<br>

<p>
Snapshot achieves this by creating a virtual drive - like W: - usable by any Windows program.</p>
<p>
This virtual drive can be used by the normal Windows Explorer.<br>

Here are <a href="view1.htm"><b>Screenshots</b></a> how to view a saved disk image.<br>


Main use: You can view/compare files without restoring them first.<br>


</p>

<p>First you have to&nbsp; select the disk image you want to explore.<br>
You see
some information about the saved disk at the time of Backup to help you to find
the right image, should there be more than one.</p>
<p>Additionally, you may choose the drive letter the virtual drive shall have;
Drive Snapshot will automatically use the highest drive letter available (Z:).</p>
<p>Click <a href="view2.htm">Map and Explore Virtual Drive</a> to mount the
drive and start the Windows Explorer on the drive.</p>
<p>Click <a href="view2.htm">Map Virtual Drive</a> to mount the drive only
without starting Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;

</p>

<h3>Partial Restore</h3>

You can do a <b>partial Restore</b>, simply by dragging and dropping files with Windows Explorer.<br>

And, since it's a virtual drive, the image can be used by any other Windows/DOS
program, not just an 'explorer like' browser.<br>

Simply use the tools you like most to view/compare/restore files.<br>


When viewing a saved NTFS partition, the virtual drive will have exactly the same security attributes, owner ship, compressed state, encrypted state,...<br>
as the original disk.<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
Snapshot virtual disk has performance similar to a real disk.<br>

Depending on the conditions, expect 50-120% of the speed of the real disk (yes, sometimes it's faster:-).<br>
For instance, Win2K backup will
back up my Win2K System disk in 7:43; while saving the same drive as a virtual disk takes 10:28, or about 35% slower.<br>

<p>
Most important - it will never feel slow.<br>
