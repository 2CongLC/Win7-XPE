<h4>2 June 2005: Drive Snapshot 1.36 RC5</h4>

<p>new features:</p>

<p>backup:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#FF0000">Compatibility with Windows 2003 Server SP1</font>
<li>
partitions without a drive letter (mounted at mountpoints)
<li>
unrecognised partitions (Compaq/HP/Dell service partitions)
<li>
Linux Ext2/Ext3/Reiser/Swap partitions
<li>
image files are saved as unfragmented as possible
<li>
USB sticks should be supported
<li>
our first attempt to use some graphic in the windows user interface ;)&nbsp;
</ul>

<p>Restore:</p>

<ul>
<li>
to all partitions mentioned above
<li>
when restoring from Windows/BartPE, allows resizing of NTFS file system to the
partition size.<br>

Resizing up is always possible; resizing down only to the size of the highest
used&nbsp;<br>
sector on the disk (basically: what you see in disk defragmenter), NOT to the
used data size;<br>
no defragmentation on the fly is attempted.<br>

</ul>

<p>Bugs fixed:</p>

<ul>
<li>
previous versions allowed mounting of images with &lt;= 256 image .sn1, .sn2,...pieces<br>
now up to 65535 pieces (of max 256 TB each) are mountable
<li>
supports image mounting in Win 2000/Win 2003 Terminal server environment
<li>
behaves better, if memory cards (MMC etc.) aren't plugged in
<li>
a couple of minor things (as usual)
<li>
the described procedure to convert the networkbootdisk.sna into a 'real' image,
suitable to burn a bootable CD, had a bug.<br>
fixed.<br>

</ul>

<p>This is a pre-release version of Drive Snapshot 1.36.<br>
While we don't expect
any bugs, we are still testing it before finally releasing it.<br>
If you find any
bugs, feedback is appreciated.</p>
