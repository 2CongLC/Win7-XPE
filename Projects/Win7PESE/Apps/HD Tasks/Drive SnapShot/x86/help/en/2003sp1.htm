<h4>20 May 2005: Drive Snapshot 1.35 does NOT work with Windows 2003 SP1</h4>

<p><b>Symptom: </b>old version of Drive Snapshot don't work with Windows 2003 SP1.<br>

The image will be written correctly, but after that the computer will hang
and has to be power-cycled.<br>
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this required significant changes in the driver part, so this
version has been tested on much less platforms/environments then 'normal' Snapshot.<br>

</p>

<p>For this reason, for the moment the 'normal' 1.36 RC3 contains the old, tried
and true driver, and only this version includes the required changed driver for
Win2003-SP1.<br>

</p>

<p>While we expect it to work as well as the old version on all supported
platforms, it's sometimes good to
be conservative.<br>
