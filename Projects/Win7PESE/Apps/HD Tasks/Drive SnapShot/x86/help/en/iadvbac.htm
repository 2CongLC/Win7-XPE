<h2>

Advanced Options</h2>


<p>

None of these options are important for the normal use of Drive Snapshot;
usually you should use the default settings.<br>


</p>

<h3>VSS Options</h3>
<p>forces or disables use of VSS (Volume Shadowcopy Service); <a href="snapshot_vss.htm">see
also</a>&nbsp;</p>


<p>

&nbsp;

</p>

<h3>
Maximum size of a single image file

</h3>

<p>Disk image files can become rather large, if saving big partitions.<br>
However
they should not be larger then certain limits, else they will not be usable by
DOS (limit = 2047 MB) or will not fit on a CD-R/W (Limit 650-750MB)or an ISO-DVD
(Limit 2048 MB).<br>


</p>

<p>So Snapshot will cut the disk image file after a preset size (default=650MB),
and create several files with extensions&nbsp;<br>
SNA, .SN1,.Sn2,..,.SN9,.S10...S99,.100...999,.1000 etc

</p>

<p>By default the limit is 1500 MB, so 3 image pieces fit on a DVD.<br>


</p>

<h3>
Maintenance Mode&nbsp;

</h3>

<p>
This saves each and every cluster on the disk, ignoring the free space
information.<br>


</p>

<p>
This has its use if you are trying some&nbsp; 'Data Recovery' Tool to recover
some data from a damaged disk, but want to be able to restore the original state
in case the 'recovery' fails.<br>


</p>

<h3>Hash File Options</h3>
<p>Usually, with each full backup, also a .HSH hashfile is created, which is
used for differential images.</p>
<p>If you don't plan to use differential backup, clear this option.</p>
<p>with <b>[Create Hash file from full image] </b>you can recreate a .hsh file
from the full image.</p>

<h3>
Use settings as default

</h3>

<p>Saves these settings to be used as new default settings.<br>
