<h1>Snapshot - Trialware Download</h1>

<p>You are invited to test Snapshot, before you buy.</p>
<p>We offer you to download this Trial ware of Snapshot; check it at your
leisure,
and see if it can be useful to you and your company.<br>
Only after verifying its
functionality, you are required to buy it.</p>
<p>The Trial ware version has a built-in time limit of approx.
30 days, after
which it won't backup any longer.<br>
There are no other restrictions in the Trial ware
version.</p>
<p>You are allowed to use Snapshot for a 30 day period, after which you must either
<a href="order.htm" target="_blank">BUY</a>  it, or stop using it.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Specifically in a corporate environment, where dozens or hundreds of
computers must be backed up, the need to install software (and usually reboot it
after installation), can be annoying.</p>
Drive Snapshot does not <b>require </b>an installation.<p>It's sufficient to
download <a href="http://www.drivesnapshot.de/download/snapshot.exe"><b>SNAPSHOT.EXE</b></a>&nbsp; 
(about 350KByte) and to start it.</p>
<p>For pure 64-Bit Environments (WindowsPE and Windows64 Setup DVDs) you need 
the 64-bit <b><a href="http://www.drivesnapshot.de/download/snapshot64.exe">
SNAPSHOT64.EXE</a></b>.<br>

The normal 32-Bit Snapshot.exe runs on any version of Windows.</p>
<p>If you prefer a 'normal' installation, please download <a href="http://www.drivesnapshot.de/download/setup.exe"><b>SETUP.EXE</b></a>
 (about 3,5 MB).</p>
<p>SETUP copies Snapshot.exe into the \Programs directory, creates Start Menu
entries, installs Help files (currently this website), and installs the
necessary data to create a bootable DOS recovery diskette.</p>
<p>A complete Snapshot Setup requires about 2 MB free disk space.</p>
<p>Snapshot/Setup will <b>NOT </b>copy anything into your Windows or system
directory.<br>

Snapshot/Setup will <b>NOT</b> change anything in your system's configuration.<br>

Everything necessary for Snapshot's operation will be dynamically done and undone.</p>
<p>Snapshot is intended to backup your computer in its present state, not to
modify this state.</p>
<p>
You need <b>NOT</b> to exit other programs to install Snapshot.</p>
<p>
Just start it - and enjoy.</p>
<h3>64Bit Recovery Environment</h3>
<p>In 64 Bit Recovery environments (WindowsPE, BartPE, 64 Bit Win7 Setup) 
the 'normal' 32-bit Snapshot.exe doesn't work ('the required subsystem is 
missing' or similar). In these cases use the 64-bit <b>
<a href="http://www.drivesnapshot.de/download/snapshot64.exe">
Snapshot64.exe</a></b></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<h3>System Requirements:</h3>
<p>2 MB disk space for full installation.<br>

15 MB memory when running.<br>

Enough disk space for the backup data.<br>

Administrative rights.<br>
