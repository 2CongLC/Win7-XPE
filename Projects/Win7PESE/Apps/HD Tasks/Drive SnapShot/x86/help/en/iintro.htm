SnapShot is disk imaging software that enables the user to back up, restore and view
backed up hard disk data, easily and
safely.<br>

Using WindowsNT driver technology, Snapshot brings two new features to disk imaging:
<p></p>

<h2>1.<br>
Snapshot Backup - create disk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; images while Windows is running</h2>

This allows the user to work in his usual environment when backing up his data.<br>
<br>
Any device suitable for file storage can be used for the image destination, like
your local drive, a network drive or any removable drive
<p>
And - most important - the image will be an <b>industrial quality image</b>, even though WinNT
constantly writes to the disk.<br>

The user may continue to work normally, while a backup operation is in progress; the image  will still be valid and consistent.<br>

This enables one of the most important things in backup business: <b>backup often</b>
<p>
It is even possible to make an <b>image backup for servers</b>, that must be online 24 hours
a day.<br>

<h3>Snapshot Backup - Main use</h3>
Snapshot Backup is aimed at the backup/disaster recovery market.<br>
There is little use for on the fly disk image creation, if you want to deploy hundreds or thousands of workstations.<br>

We think however, that the possibility to do on the fly backup is very important for the end user to
regularly protect his data.<br>
At least, this was our reason to create Snapshot.<br>

No need to shut down and boot from floppy, no need to create network disks, and no need to wait half an hour for the backup process - we think that's nice.<br>



<h2>2.<br>
Snapshot View - Explore saved disk images the friendly way</h2>
The image file is presented to the user as a virtual drive.<br>
This virtual drive can be used like any other drive, using any Windows program, be it Explorer, Norton Commander, or your
favourite MP3 Player.<br>

<h3>Snapshot View - Main use</h3>
Snapshot View is a very easy and powerful method to explore disk images.<br>
This technique could be asily adapted to disk images created by other disk imaging programs.<br>


<h4>Compatibility</h4>
Drive
Snapshot works on all versions of Windows NT or better, like 
NT/2000/XP/2003/7/8/10/2008/2008R2/2016/2019 and all versions of Windows PE.<p>You need administrative rights to use Snapshot.<br>
