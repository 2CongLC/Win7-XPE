<h3>Resizing a Partition</h3>

<p>Sometimes it's useful to resize a partition</p>

<p>Drive Snapshot 1.30 supports this with the following limitations:</p>
<ul><li>Currently, only the file system inside the partition can be resized up
    to the partition size and down to the last used sector on the drive
    (resizing the partition itself is under construction)<li>Resizing is done
    only from Windows<li>resizing is implemented for NTFS only<li><b>Resize is
    currently explicitly BETA.<br>
It has been tested, and it works; however it has
    not been tested in as many different configurations as the other Snapshot
    features.<br>
use it at your own risk (though we think we won't destroy
    anything).<br>
</b>

  <li>Please close all applications (if possible) that access the disk.<br>


</ul>

<p>Resize is only available from the command line.</p>

<p>min.<br>
possible size: the minimum size of the drive, as there are some used
data at this place; it may be possible to reduce this by defragmenting the
drive.<br>
 However it's usually not possible to reduce a drives size to less
then 0.5 * the original size, as NTFS stores some system information in the
middle of the drive.<br>
So a 10 GB NTFS drive can't be made smaller then 5 GB.</p>

<h3>Resize the drive&nbsp;</h3>

<p>First, the drive is checked (using CHKDSK), if the drive is error free.<br>
If
not, Snapshot won't touch it.<br>
Please correct all errors first by running C:&gt;CHKDSK
/F first, rebooting if necessary.<br>
<b>Warning: not all file system errors are
found by the GUI CheckDisk.<br>
Please use CHKDSK /F!!</b></p>

<p>Then the drive gets resized, and brought into a controlled inconsistent
state.<br>
This is cured by CHKDSK.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Please answer all questions with 'Yes',&nbsp; and <font color="#FF0000">do
not use the drive until CHKDSK has been run without errors.<br>
</font>if necessary,
reboot windows as soon as possible!!</b></p>
