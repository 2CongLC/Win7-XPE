System Requirement
==================

This utility works under Windows 2000, Windows NT, Windows XP, Windows
Server 2003/2008, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10.
Windows 98 and Windows ME are not supported. Under Windows Vista/7/8 - If
you want to change the status of services, you must right-click the
ServiWin.exe and choose 'Run As Administrator'. If only want to watch the
services/devices list, you can also run it as non-admin user.



Using ServiWin
==============

This utility is a standalone executable, so it doesn't require any
installation process or additional DLLs. Just run the executable
(serviwin.exe) and start using it.
The main window displays the list of all drivers or services, according
to your selection. You can switch between drivers list and services list
by selecting the desired list from the View menu, or simply use the F7
and F8 keys.
You can select one or more drivers or services from the list, and then
change their status (Stop, Start, Restart, Pause, or Continue) or their
startup type (Automatic, Manual, Disabled, Boot, or System). You can also
save the selected items to text or HTML file (Ctrl + S) or copy this
information to the clipboard.

Warning: Changing the status or the startup type of some drivers or
services may cause to your operating system to work improperly. Do not
disable or stop drivers/services if you are not 100% sure about what you
are doing.



Connecting To Another Computer
==============================

ServiWin allows you to work with drivers/services list of another
computer on your LAN. In order to do that, you must be connected to the
other computer with administrator privileges, as well as admin shares
(\\computer\drive$) should be enabled on that computer.



Offline Mode
============

Starting from version 1.30, ServiWin allows you to connect another
instance of Windows operating system. In this offline mode, you cannot
stop or start a service (because the other operating system is not really
running...), but you can change the "Startup Type" of a service, so the
next time that the other operating system is loaded, the service will be
started or won't be started according to the startup type that you chooe.

In order to use ServiWin in offline mode, run ServiWin with /offline
command-line option, and specify the Windows directory of the operating
system that you want to load. For example:
serviwin.exe /offline e:\windows

Be aware that when using this offline mode, the 'SYSTEM' registry file of
the other operating system is temporarily loaded as a new hive under
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.



Colors In ServiWin
==================

Starting from v1.10, ServiWin marks the services and drivers with
different colors according to the following rules:


Blue
All started services/drivers are painted with this color.
ForeColorStarted
BackColorStarted


Red
All disabled services/drivers are painted with this color.
ForeColorDisabled
BackColorDisabled


Purple
All services/drivers that starts automatically by the operating systems
(with 'Automatic' and 'Boot' Startup types) but they are not currently
running.
ForeAutoNotStarted
BackAutoNotStarted


For advanced users only: If you want to view the services/drivers in
different colors, add the approprite line (according to the above table)
to serviwin.cfg, for example:
ForeColorStarted=10551295
Each color value is DWORD value that represents the color in RGB format.
For example: If you want to mark all started services with yellow
background color, add BackColorStarted value as DWORD containing 10551295
(0xA0FFFF).



Command-Line Options
====================

General syntax:
serviwin [/save type] [drivers | services] [filename] {\\computer} {/sort
[column name]}

The [/save type] may contain one of the following values:


/stext
Saves the list of all drivers/services into a regular text file.

/stab
Saves the list of all drivers/services into a tab-delimited text file.

/scomma
Saves the list of all drivers/services into a comma-delimited text file.

/sxml
Saves the list of all drivers/services into a xml file.

/stabular
Saves the list of all drivers/services into a tabular text file.

/shtml
Saves the list of all drivers/services into horizontal HTML file.

/sverhtml
Saves the list of all drivers/services into vertical HTML file.

The second parameter specifies whether to save the 'services' list or the
'drivers' list.
The [filename] parameter specifies the filename to save the
services/drivers list.
The remote computer parameter, {\\computer} is optional. If you omit this
parameter, the drivers/services list will be loaded from the local
computer.
You can also specify the Windows directory of external drive instead of
computer name in order to load the services/drivers list from external
drive.

The /sort command-line option can be used with other save options for
sorting by the desired column. If you don't specify this option, the list
is sorted according to the last sort that you made from the user
interface. The <column> parameter can specify the column index (0 for the
first column, 1 for the second column, and so on) or the name of the
column, like "Name" and "Display Name". You can specify the '~' prefix
character (e.g: "~Status") if you want to sort in descending order. You
can put multiple /sort in the command-line if you want to sort by
multiple columns.


Examples:

serviwin.exe  /shtml services "c:\temp\serv.html" \\comp1
serviwin.exe  /stext drivers "c:\temp\drv.txt"
serviwin.exe  /shtml services "c:\temp\serv.html" /sort "Display Name"
serviwin.exe  /shtml services "c:\temp\serv.html" K:\Windows


Starting from version 1.20, you can use the /remote parameter in order to
start ServiWin with the specified remote computer (without saving the
drivers/services to file). For example:

serviwin.exe  /remote \\comp10


In order to successfully get full admin access to the remote computer,
read this Blog post: How to connect a remote Windows 7/Vista/XP computer
with NirSoft utilities.

Starting from version 1.30, you can use /offline parameter in order to
connect another instance of Windows operating system. For example:

serviwin.exe  /offline d:\windows


You can also start ServiWin with the services list by using
/start_services parameter or with the drivers list, by using
/start_drivers parameter:

serviwin.exe /start_services
serviwin.exe /start_drivers


Starting from version 1.50, you can instruct ServiWin to load only the
desired services by using the /LoadFromList command-line option. You can
specify the desired services by their name, display name, or the .exe
file. Here's a few examples:

serviwin.exe /LoadFromList WZCSVC Spooler Schedule LmHosts Browser RemoteRegistry
serviwin.exe /LoadFromList svchost.exe
serviwin.exe /LoadFromList "C:\WINDOWS\System32\ups.exe"




Translating to another language
===============================

ServiWin allows you to easily translate all menus, dialog-boxes, and
other strings to other languages.
In order to do that, follow the instructions below:
1. Run ServiWin with /savelangfile parameter:
   serviwin.exe /savelangfile
   A file named serviwin_lng.ini will be created in the folder of
   ServiWin utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all menus, dialog-boxes, and string entries to the
   desired language.
4. After you finish the translation, Run ServiWin, and all translated
   strings will be loaded from the language file.
   If you want to run ServiWin without the translation, simply rename the
   language file, or move it to another folder.
